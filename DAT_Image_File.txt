The .DAT file used in X-wing Alliance is an archive file that can contain
hundreds of images pertaining to map icons, mouse cursors, inflight backdrops,
etc. Portions of the format are similar or directly ripped from the .ACT format
of TIE and XvT. The images are separated into "Groups" and "Subs", with the
Group being the base image, and the Sub being variants or animation frames.

**NOTE** Addition of BC7 is WIP, not all information has been added **

DAT Structure Details

Yet another image format for the X-wing series, although this one is XWA only.
Five different raw formats are bundled under this one type, the difference is
the type of bitmaps that are displayed. More on that in a sec.

As mentioned at the beginning, the images are categorized as Groups and Subs.
In my other graphical format write-ups you can equate this to Images and Frames
but for the DAT files I will stick to existing naming conventions to make it
easier for DATech and XDC users.

Three sections make up the DAT archive, the FileHeader, GroupHeader array, and
the Groups themselves.

-- FileHeader --

The main file header is fairly simple, the only issue is the large Reserved
value that starts off the file. When you use a file extension as omnipresent as
".dat", I guess you really do need some big ugly number to stand out. Doesn't
even convert to text nicely.

NumberOfGroups is one-indexed, as is NumberOfSubs which is the total for the
file. The Length value is the sum of GroupHeader.Length values. Likewise, the
NumberOfColors value is simply the sum of GroupHeader.NumberOfColors values. A
LONG of zeros, then the offset from the end of the file header to the first
Group data, which equates to NumberOfGroups * 0x18. If you remove the first
Reserved values, you can call the FileHeader just a modifed GroupHeader.

-- GroupHeader --

Every Group within XWA has a unique ID number, this is how XWA finds the
appropriate image to display when it's needed. If you install custom images and
botch the Group or Sub ID, you're not going to get the results you're looking
for.

NumberOfSubs should be simple enough, this is a one-indexed value. Length is
the total length occupied by the Group's Subs. NumberOfColors is the total
one-indexed sum of all Color declarations in the Group's Subs, not just unique
values.

The DataOffset value once read is the offset at which the first Sub of that
Group is defined, also equals the sum of previous GroupHeader.GroupLength
values. The first Group will always have a value of zero. Using these values
alone a jump table can be constructed to the separate groups. This is similar
to the FrameOffset value in ACT files.
GroupHeader[0].DataOffset = 0
GroupHeader[i].DataOffset = GroupHeader[i-1].DataOffset+GroupHeader[i-1].Length

-- Group and Sub --

I'm throwing these under the same subheader because there's really nothing to
the Group struct, it just makes organization and code easier to write. There is
no physical separation between Groups, if you were reading a hex dump the only
clue would be that the IDs change in the images.

Subs contain two headers, one for the sub itself and the other is actually the
heading from the ACT image format. Why they felt the need to use the ACT header
is unknown, unless they just modified the existing read/write code with a new
type. The Type determines the format of the image and how it needs to be read.
0x07	Bitmap with transparency (8bpp), compressed
0x17	Alpha blended bitmap (32bpp), compressed
0x18	Alpha blended bitmap (32bpp), uncompressed
0x19	Full ARGB image (32bpp), uncompressed
0x19	Full ARGB image (32bpp), LZMA compressed (aka "25C")
0x19	BC7 Compressed ("BC7")

Yes, the last ones are all 0x19. This is more a "Hook Image" format value.
Full ARGB uncompressed is simple type 0x19, no colors. LZMA compressed or "25C"
is indicated by having ImageHeader.NumberOfColors (couple paragraphs down)
equal to 1. There really aren't any colors defined so that array is empty, but
that's the way that 25C is flagged. BC7 gets detected if the pixel data is
smaller than it would be for fully uncompressed ARGB, again no colors.
In other words: SubHeader.Length - ImageHeaderLength < Width * Height * 4.

Width and Height are easy enough, they're one-indexed values. The GroupID and
SubID values should also be self-explanatory. SubHeader.Length could also be
viewed as the offset to the next sub; the value is the total length of the
following ImageHeader, Color array and Row array. Similar to how the DataOffset
values of the GroupHeader array could create a jump table for the groups,
reading the Length values can build a jump table of the Subs within the Group.

ImageHeader starts off with a value we just left behind, and it'll show up a
third time in a sec. ImageHeaderLength is a constant 0x2C. ImageDataOffset is
the offset from the beginning of the ImageHeader to the first Row. Equates to
0x2C+NumberOfColors*3. For those of you paying attention, this means the total
length of the Row array is SubHeader.Length-ImageDataOffset. Working down the
rest of the header, a lot of values we've seen already, and NumberOfColors
finishes it off. Many of the "Reserved" values throughout are placeholders that
are used for storing values in-game.

The Colors array is a simple 3-byte RGB list, with the first index being the
transparency color. Typically it's (0,0,0), and if black is used in the image
it tends to be the second index as well.

-- Rows --

Okay, here's where most of the magic happens. The only common similarity
between the first three Types are the length of the Rows array itself, and that
they are all indexed color images. Once we get to Type 25 (which again requires
a hook to be installed) then there's little to no processing that needs to be
done and the size of Row doubles. For Type 25C, the rows are omitted entirely
since the data is LZMA compressed and is processed separately.

First off, Type 7; Transparent. Mostly used as the backdrop type, it also
has the tightest compression rate for filesize. The Row starts off with the
NumberOfOperations value. That determines the length of the OpCode array, which
at most will have a total size of Width*2. Being true to the ACT format, the
OpCodes behave with a Shift value of 7, meaning that 7 bits are used for the
width of the operation in pixels for a maximum of 127px.

If the top bit of the OpCode is used (value >= 0x80) then the operation only
occupies a single byte, and defines a length of transparent pixels. Simply
subtract 0x80 from the value to get the pixel length.

If the top bit is not used, then it is a simple Read operation. The face value
of the OpCode is the number of consecutive ColorIndexes to be read. In both
cases, another OpCode immediately follows the last value until the end of the
row. The end of the image is marked by zero byte.

Type 23 (0x17); Blended. A good example of these would be the cockpit overlays,
allows partial transparency. Like Type 7, The Row starts off with the
NumberOfOperations followed by the OpCode array. OpCode behaviour is that of
Shift 6, so only the bottom 6 bits are used for lengths, meaning a maximum of
63px can be defined in one shot.

The 0x80 and 0x40 bits have two different uses to determine the OpCode's
behaviour together. When both are used (Value >= 0xC0) it is the same as the
Transparent Repeat from Type 7, only as stated previously there's 6 bits for
the length value.

When 0x80 is true and 0x40 is not (0x80 <= Value < 0xC0) it is a Read
operation, but with the Pixel array instead of straight ColorIndexes. For each
pixel, the ColorIndex is preceded by its Alpha value which defines the opacity.
A value of 255 is completely visible, and zero is completely transparent. XDC I
know displays this Type without the blending, it assumes all are visible.
That's why if you look in Craft_Icons.dat you'll see Group 14100 with some
"ghosting" on the side. Those are actually transparent pixels, I don't know why
they're even there.

When neither bit is used (Value < 0x40) then it is a plain Read operation.
The length of bytes is read and treated as Alpha 255, completely opaque. Like
Type 7, the end of the image data is marked with a zero byte.

Type 24 (0x18); Uncompressed Blended. No compression at all, this Type requires
two bytes per pixel; the ColorIndex first, and then the Alpha value, which
again goes from 0 transparent to 255 opaque. This type does not use an
end-of-image marker. Back to Craft_Icons.dat again, if you remove the Alpha
channel you'll see that the Subs are actually stacked on top of each other,
they used the Alpha channel to remove old pixels instead of leaving them blank.

Important note for in-flight images such as backdrops: the original flight
engine simplifies the constructed 8888 32bpp image in the DAT to a 1555 16bpp
image, so a backdrop won't have nice feathered edges. It can be patched to
treat them as 4444 16bpp, which gives 16 levels of alpha blending at the cost
of color detail. For best results, we can use the next type...

Type 25 (0x19); Full ARGB, requires 32-bit hook. This type due to its nature is
a little bit different in how it's handled throughout the image. First off,
since it's full ARGB there's no indexed color, so FileHeader.NumberOfColors is
zero (which of course means all Group.NumberOfColors values are zero) and
Sub.ImageHeaderOffset is 0x2C since there's no Color array to skip over.

For the image data itself, it's simple raw pixel data at this point, four bytes
in the BGRA order with no extra termination data, they go from one to the next.

Type "25C"; Full ARGB, LZMA compressed, requires 32-bit hook. The
data is the same as 25, however it's stored as LZMA compressed data. Per the
LZMA documentation, the first 5 bytes are the compression parameters that
defines exactly how it's stored.

Type "BC7"; BCn compressed, requires 32-bit hook. The data length is the size
of the padded area, with padding up to multiples of 4 in both width and height.
((Width+3)/4 * 4) * ((Height+3)/4 * 4). Note that for dimensions that are
already divisible by 4, this is simply Width * Height.
